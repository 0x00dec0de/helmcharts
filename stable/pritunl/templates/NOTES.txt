** The chart is being deployed. You can check on its progress using kubectl get pods/services. **

Local hostname for internal resolution, provided the local cluster name for DNS resolution has not been changed:

    {{ template "pritunl.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

This chart should only be deployed after a MongoDB instance has been provisioned. It is recommended to use the official MongoDB chart.

Standard configuration dictates that the MongoDB instance is reachable via:
    
    pritunl-mongodb.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

Check /var/log/pritunl.log or run "kubectl logs pritunl" for additional troubleshooting information during startup. The service will not be reachable if the database could not be contacted.

It is extremely important to verify that the annotations section in pritunl-service.yaml is uncommented (if commented out) after local testing is complete as these are necessary for an AWS ELB to work properly.

If testing locally, you can port forward to the webui using the following command:

    sudo kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/pritunl 443:443 (or whatever port you've chosen for the webui)
